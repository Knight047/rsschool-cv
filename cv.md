## Briefly About Myself
My name is Eldar, I am a project manager in an oil and gas engineering company. I am 27 years old. 5 years ago I graduated from the Higher Economic University and since then I have been building a career in the chosen direction. But lately my profession has ceased to bring me pleasure. To date, I have become interested in programming on my own and, by a lucky chance, found courses at the RSSchool school. I believe that I will be able to master the profession of a Frontend developer and finally do what I love to do programming.
